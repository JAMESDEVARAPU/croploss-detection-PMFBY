The page is still loading. Let me check the detailed logs and wait for Vite to finish compiling:


Decided on cache clearing approach
Let me restart the workflow to clear the Vite cache issue:


Executed sleep 15 && echo "Waited for Vite to compile"

Agent ran into an error

Determined Vite optimization issue
Let me check if there are any errors by looking at the full log file:


Executed tail -n 50 /tmp/logs/Start_application_20251008_132529_024.log 2>&1 | grep -v "^<" || cat /tmp/logs/Start_application_20251008_132529_024.log

Assessed Vite optimization issues
Let me try a different approach and test the server directly:


Executed timeout 3 curl -v http://localhost:5000/ 2>&1 | head -30

Changed server bind address (8 seconds)
I see the issue - the server is hanging because Vite is stuck optimizing dependencies. Also, based on the feedback, let me change the server to bind to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0:


Edited server/index.ts

Decided on server binding address
Actually, wait - for Replit to work externally, we need to bind to 0.0.0.0. Let me revert that and fix the Vite optimization issue instead:


Decided on Vite optimization strategy
Let me optimize the Vite configuration to fix the hanging issue:


Executed sleep 20 && echo "Waited for Vite"

Agent ran into an error

Decided on server Vite setup
The Vite optimization is still stuck. Let me check the server/vite.ts setup to see if there's an issue:


Opened server/vite.ts

Planned Vite configuration integration
I found the issue! The setupVite function isn't using our vite.config.ts. Let me fix it to use the configuration:


Decided on dependency re-optimization
Great! The Vite optimization issue is resolved - no more "Forced re-optimization" message. Let me take a screenshot now:


Agent ran into an error

Decided on debugging approach
Let me test if the page is responding at all:


Executed timeout 5 curl -s http://localhost:5000/ | head -20 || echo "Request timed out or failed"

Decided on static frontend serving (6 seconds)
The server is still hanging. Let me try a different approach - let's build the frontend and serve it statically instead of using Vite in development mode:


Executed npm run build 2>&1 | tail -30

Planned server configuration adjustments
Perfect! The build completed. Now let me update the server to serve the static build:
